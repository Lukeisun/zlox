this is my Zig implementation of the treewalk intrepreter from
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)!

Admittedly code isn't the best it could be, but this is my first 
venture into Zig. Translating the Java into Zig has been quite painful.
This has led to a couple of hacky implementations that made sense when I wrote them
but I probably couldn't tell you what they do now. 
After a while I kinda got in the groove of it though and it aktually works!


Isn't that awesome?

So if you're looking at this for reference, maybe you shouldn't or do whatever; it's your life.
